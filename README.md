KilledByFire
============

Minecraft server mod for papermc that lets you set living things on fire by hitting them with a torch. Also the zombies
will only be able to get killed if they are on fire.

Tested with version 1.16.5 but should be possible to recompile and use a different version as well possibly.


How to install
--------------

 1. Compile project using `gradlew jar`. This will create `killedbyfire-1.0.jar` in `build/libs/` directory.
 2. Drop `killedbyfire-1.0.jar` in the `plugins` folder of your papermc server.
 3. Enjoy!
